gdp_per_capita_cppp,"This file contains data compiled by Gapminder.org, based on multiple sources, as described in the documentation link below. The data is part of Gapminder effort to build a fact-based worldview by showing the big picture of global development. When we find multiple data sources that haven't been combined we combine them into one consistent timeseries. This often results in large data uncertainty, as the underlaying data-sources use different methodologies etc. But we still dare to combine data that hasn't been combined, as we find it extremely important to visualize the big picture, which people otherwise tend to get absolutely wrong. Before using our data for any other purpose though, please read the documentation to make sure you are aware of our levels of doubts in the data.",Here are Gapminderâ€™s guidelines on reasonable doubt for different kinds of data: gapm.io/doubt.,"In order to make it easy for people to follow the development of the countries they are familiar with. Our data refer to countries in the past as if they always had the boundaries they have today. Historic territories, such as USSR may sometimes also have estimates in out datatables, so be careful not to sum all rows into a total, as you will then double count many people.

PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

a. World Bank: For the period 1990 to 2016, data is identical to The World Bank's indicator: GDP per capita constant PPP 2011, (except for a few countries that were estimated by Gapminder, including Syria and Cuba). See: gapm.io/xwb171
b. Maddison: Data before 1990, is based on Gapminder's historic estimates by Mattias Lindgren, which mainly uses Maddison data. See: gapm.io/histdata.
c. IMF: Data after 2016 uses IMF's forecasts for GDP per capita WEO 2017, october revision: gapm.io/ximfw
d. The IMF forecast reaches only to 2022.
